**Data Scraping Project**
This project demonstrates web scraping techniques using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium. It focuses on extracting data from different websites for analysis, including IMDb movie casting information, U.S. state details, and the list of active Indian military aircraft from Wikipedia, along with data from open-source web scraping practice sites.

**Objective**
The aim of this project was to apply real-world web scraping techniques using Python. I utilized BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape and analyze data from live web pages, including IMDb, Wikipedia, and other open-source web platforms. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in data extraction and basic analysis.

**Technologies Used**
Python: For scripting and executing the data scraping processes.
BeautifulSoup: To parse and extract data from static HTML pages.
Selenium: For handling dynamic content and JavaScript-rendered pages.
Pandas: For structuring and analyzing the scraped data.
Requests: To make HTTP requests and retrieve web content.
