**Data Scraping Project**
This project demonstrates web scraping techniques using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium. It involves extracting data from websites such as IMDb for movie casting information, U.S. state details from Wikipedia, and other open-source web scraping practice sites.

**Objective**
The goal of this project was to apply web scraping techniques in a real-world context using Python. By utilizing BeautifulSoup and Selenium, I extracted and analyzed data from various sources, including IMDb and Wikipedia. This hands-on approach allowed me to gain practical experience in data scraping and analysis.

**Technologies Used**
Python: For scripting and automation.
BeautifulSoup: For parsing static HTML.
Selenium: To handle dynamic, JavaScript-rendered content.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Requests: For making HTTP requests.
